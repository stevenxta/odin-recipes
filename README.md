# odin-recipes

This project is the first project in The Odin Project curriculum.

The purpose of this project is to get familiar with using basic HTML and CSS.

My project consists of a starting page that links to three different recipes. Within those links, the content contains a title, image, description, ingredients, as well as instructions on how to make the dish.
